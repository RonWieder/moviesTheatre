# MoviesTheatre

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.

## Run the app

After cloning the repository, cd to created directory (by default 'moviesTheatre') and run `npm i`. Then cd to `/server` directory and run `npm i` again.
cd back one directory (should be in 'moviesTheatre' directory) and if all installation processes have finished, run `npm start`, and in different trminal, in same directory, run `npm run server`.
Then, after both - web server and the node.js server are up and runnning, open your browser in [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
Hope you'll enjoy the app :)

## Compiled code

An optimized, minified, production ready (which was built using a script I added, that makes use of some of angular cli optimization build process flags) version of the code can be found in the /public directory.
